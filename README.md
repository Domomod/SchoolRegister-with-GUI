# SchoolRegister-with-GUI
Xamarin.Mac Modern application for High Sierra or newest OS.
This app is prepared for MariaDB, if you want to use it with different data base, it may not work properly.

It is simple School Register app. There are 4 modes: 
-student (only showing info about him/her), 
-parent (showing info about children and legitimize their absence), 
-teacher (adding notes, checking presance etc),
-admin mode (adding, changing and deleting most of things).

I'm aware of awfulness of this code, every time a GUI appears in my project, it changes itself into a monster. 
If you really want to look at it: ViewController, Backendoptions, MyCombo and SQLChecker are the only ones with important code.
